tar-reader-php
==============

Tar file reading library.

With TarReader you can browse the contents of a tarball, not just extract it.

### Basic usage

First require `biohzrdmx/tar-reader-php` with Composer.

Then just create a `TarReader` instance passing an archive path:

```php
use TarReader\TarReader;

$tar = new TarReader( __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'file.tar.gz' );
```

The library supports `tar`, `tar.gz` and `tar.bz2` archives.

To get the contents of the archive call the `getEntries` method:

```php
$entries = $tar->getEntries();
```

This function returns an array of objects, each with the following properties:

- `checksum` - Checksum of the entry, example: `5989`
- `filename` - File name, example: `"lorem.txt"`
- `perm` - Permission mask, example: `511`
- `uid` - Numeric user ID of the file owner, example: `1000`
- `gid` - Numeric group ID of the file owner, example: `1000`
- `size` - Size, in bytes, example: `19`
- `mtime` - Last modified timestamp, example: `1668473650`
- `typeflag` - Type of entry, example: `"0"`
- `link` - Link name, if applicable, example: `""`
- `uname` - User name of the file owner, example: `"www-data"`
- `gname` - Group name of the file owner, example: `"www-data"`
- `offset` - Entry offset, example: `2560`

You can also get the contents of an specific entry with the `readEntry` method:

```php
$entry = $entries[1] ?? null;
if ($entry) {
  $data = $tar->readEntry($entry);
  file_put_contents(__DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $entry->filename, $data);
}
```
